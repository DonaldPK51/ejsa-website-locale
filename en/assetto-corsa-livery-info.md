# Livery info
## Livery templates
Firstly, if you're going to use a custom livery please reserve the number through the [Livery Submission](https://ejsa.space/games/assetto/livery-submit) page.  
Here's a temporary spreadsheet with all the reserved car numbers.

Secondly, livery templates are available and linked below. These are .psd files and require Photoshop, [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) with a .psd plugin to open.  
There are some layers that are not supposed to be touched (edited, hidden, etc.) and are required to be on the final design: all the series sponsors, car brand/model stickers and controller device type (wheel or controller, leave the one you're using visible).  
If any help is required or you don't know how to make a livery but want one, please don't hesitate to ask.
