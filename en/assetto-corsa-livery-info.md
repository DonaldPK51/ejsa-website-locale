# Livery info
## Livery templates
Firstly, here's a spreadsheet with all the available and reserved car numbers. If you're going to use a custom livery please let us know and we'll reserve a number for you. 
It's first come, first serve as there's really no better way to do this.

[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VBlGMenDzSyw7FgVKSSwu8EjR8U9fzolCj8kF4WGozA/edit?usp=sharing)

Secondly, livery templates are available and linked below. These are .psd files and require Photoshop, [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) with a .psd plugin to open.
There are some layers that are not supposed to be touched (edited, hidden, etc.) and are required to be on the final design: all the series sponsors, car brand/model stickers and controller device type (wheel or controller, leave the one you're using visible). If any help is required or you don't know how to make a livery but want one, please don't hesitate to ask.
