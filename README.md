# The EJ_SA Website Locale

This repository is for the locale of the EJ_SA website.

If there is a page that is not here, feel free to create a PR to add it. Right now it is just the Mission Mode Rules that has locale, but I aim to make the whole site based on this repo, with it also accounting for different languages.

Submit an issue for language requests or for website bugs/feature requests.

Submit PRs for contributing language translations.
